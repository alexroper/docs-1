# Where to Go From Here

Craft CMS is a powerful tool for modeling and managing content as you need it. We’ve kept the tutorial focused on basic concepts to build a common, simple type of website—but there’s more to explore to get a better sense of how Craft CMS can support whatever’s needed for the complexities of *your* project.

## Recommended exploring

If you’d like to explore further, here are some immediate tasks you might tackle.

### Beginner: extend the demo

- Expose blog post author details. (Hint: use `dd` on `entry.author` to see what’s there.)
- Customize the homepage to match your site.
- Add more posts and integrate pagination in your templates.
- Add an RSS feed using the example at <https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/examples/rss-feed.html>.
- Use the contact form plugin to add a form to your site.

### Intermediate: go deeper with Craft

- Add a new section to the site like portfolios, press releases, or recipes.
- Add multiple sites to your installation that cross-promote content or offer it in different languages.
- Add a Structure section to the site for creating specialized marketing landing pages.
- Create a store using [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce).
- Optimize template performance with eager loading.
- Build a custom plugin or module with your own business logic.

## Sites built with Craft CMS

Consider the breadth of industries and technical considerations [in some case studies](https://craftcms.com/in-the-field) and options in [the plugin store](https://plugins.craftcms.com/). Craft’s strength is in its ability to be tailored for the experience you’re looking to create. Your ideas and your content come first.
