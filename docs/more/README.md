# Where to Go From Here

Craft CMS is a powerful tool for modeling and managing content as you need it. We’ve kept the tutorial focused on basic concepts to build a common, simple type of website—but there’s more to explore to get a better sense of how Craft CMS can support whatever’s needed for the complexities of *your* project.

## Recommended exploring

If you’d like to explore further, here are some immediate tasks you might tackle.

### Beginner: extend the demo

- Expose blog post author details. (Hint: use [`dd`](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/tags/dd.html) on `entry.author` to see what’s there, or consult the [User element API documentation](https://docs.craftcms.com/api/v3/craft-elements-user.html).)
- Customize the homepage (`index.twig`) to match your site.
- Add more posts and integrate [pagination](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/tags/paginate.html) in your templates.
- Add an RSS feed using the example [in the documentation](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/examples/rss-feed.html).
- Use the [Contact Form plugin](https://plugins.craftcms.com/contact-form) to add a form to your site.

### Intermediate: go deeper with Craft

- Add a new section to the site like portfolios, press releases, or recipes.
- Add multiple [sites](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/sites.html) to your installation that cross-promote content or offer it [in different languages](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/localization.html).
- Add a [Structure section](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/sections-and-entries.html#sections) to the site for creating specialized marketing landing pages.
- Create a store using [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce).
- Optimize template performance with [caching](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/tags/cache.html) and [eager loading](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/dev/eager-loading-elements.html).

### Advanced: extend Craft’s core functionality

- [Build a custom plugin or module](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/extend/) using your own business logic.
- Familiarize yourself with [the Yii 2.0 documentation](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en), since Craft CMS is an application built on that framework.
