Type

:   Abstract Class

Namespace

:   craft\enums

Inherits

Since

The LicenseKeyStatus class is an abstract class that defines all of the license key status states that are available
in Craft.

This class is a poor man's version of an enum, since PHP does not have support for native enumerations.
