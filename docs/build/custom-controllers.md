# Write a custom API Controller

Controllers are PHP code built within Craft CMS and its underlying framework, Yii. They receive HTTP requests and send responses, and they afford lots of flexibility as long as you’re comfortable working with PHP.

If you need something specific from a Craft CMS API that’s not possible with GraphQL or the Element API, writing your own controller is probably the way to go.

We recommend starting with the [Controllers](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/extend/controllers.html) Craft CMS documentation, and more broadly with Yii’s [Controllers](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-controllers) documentation as well. You can generate scaffolding for custom a module or plugin at <https://pluginfactory.io/>, and the [Extending Craft](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/extend/) section of the documentation should help you get comfortable with the pieces involved.
